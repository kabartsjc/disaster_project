## ðŸ“¶ The Emulation Part of the Project <a name = "sol_desc"></a>

To support the scenario description of the final project and become more realistic, we suggest using the [Mininet-Wifi](https://mininet-wifi.github.io/) project to emulate the basic network infrastructure. The basic idea is to create a set of the victim's nodes and drone networks in the emulation environment, which works like a communication relay to enable the victims to send these data to the Rescue Center. 

Unlike the real nodes, which use a [real app implementation](../android/ANDROID.md) (Android and  React-Native), the emulate ones use a Python implementation to be easiest for the node development and its integration with Mininet. 

The drone nodes are emulated. The idea is to use [Mosquitto as a bridge broker](../mosquitto/MOSQUITTO.md), forwarding all messages received from the client nodes (real or emulated ones) to the central broker in the cloud.


An example of a victim node (publish agent) in Python script is [**HERE**](../android/mqtt_publish.py).

An example of a drone node (bridge broker agent) using Mosquitto script is [**HERE**](../mosquitto/mosquitto_bridge.conf).
