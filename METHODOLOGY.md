## üßë‚Äçüè≠Group Organization

It is a group activity for students from CYSE 587 and SYST 687. **Each gropu must have 5 students (maximum number)**. I suggested that each group consist of a mix of cyber security and system engineering students, intending to have strong cyber and system engineering foundations.

The group selection is free; the instructor will not facilitate group formation. This means the students must self-organize themselves into groups based on their self-preferences to develop the project.

Each group must elect a leader who is responsible for the submission of the artifacts of the project.

**The group leader must submit a Word doc file containing the full names of the group members, the leader, and the theme name until week 4 in Canvas**.

**Each group must create a GitHub repository to store the project files. The instructors will use the repository to grade the individuals based on how much each member contributes to the final artifacts.**


### üòé The Task Description

This project aims to analyze security and privacy threats in implementing a crisis management system like the one proposed in [Solution Description](SOLUTION_DESCRIPTION.md). To do so, each group, using the theoretical foundations learned in class, must analyze the proposed problem, understanding in detail its functional and non-functional requirements, in addition to those of security and privacy, as the enumerating and ranking the threats based on its impact on the system. Next, they need to select controls and change the architecture design to make the solution comply with the developed risk analysis.

To perform the above task, one must apply the frameworks, methods, and techniques learned in the classroom. A final implementation of the system is not required; however, the final architecture of the system must reflect the real implementation concepts. For example, if you define the system as implemented in a specific cloud, the components must reflect the cloud services and tools solutions.

The provided [general architecture](SOLUTION_DESCRIPTION.md) is a high-level abstraction version of the desired system. The group's task is to improve its description and insert the missing components to make the final solution more meaningful.

I remember you; it is a graduate cyber-security system engineering course. The activity did not define modeling language; you can choose between UML or SysML. However, it is a graduate course; it is not part of the course to teach you how to create the different diagrams using the correct syntax following the standard rules; it is your job, and during the evaluation, we assume you already have these skills. If you do not have it, please check these references:

- [SYSML Resource](https://sysml.org/tutorials/)
- [UML Resource](https://www.uml.org/resource-hub.htm)


At the end of the projects, students must write a report showing their findings and lessons learned during the project development.
